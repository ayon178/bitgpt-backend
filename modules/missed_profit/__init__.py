# Missed Profit Handling Module
# Handle missed profits and distribute via Leadership Stipend
# MISSED REWARDS USUALLY OCCUR FOR TWO REASONS:
# 1. Account Inactivity: The account is inactive and does not have two personal partners
# 2. Level Advancement: A member advances to a higher level than their sponsor
# SUCH REWARDS ARE ACCUMULATED IN THE LEADERSHIP STIPEND AND DISTRIBUTED AMONG MEMBERS WHO ACHIEVE THE TARGETS
