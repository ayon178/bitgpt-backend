| 8    | 64566.7      |
```

### MISMATCHES:
1. **No Fancy Phase Names** - Images show simple "Phase 1" and "Phase 2" with slot numbers
2. **Different Price Structure** - Prices don't match the documented structure
3. **Only 8 Slots per Phase** - Images show 8 slots per phase, not the complex structure documented

---

## 8. FUND DISTRIBUTION PERCENTAGES

### Current Documentation:
Shows various bonus percentages scattered throughout.

### MISMATCHES:
1. **Different Percentages** - Images show different percentages than documented
2. **Missing Programs** - Some programs mentioned in documentation not in images
3. **Additional Programs** - Images show programs not in documentation

---

## 9. MISSING PROGRAMS IN DOCUMENTATION

### Programs in Images but Missing/Incomplete in Documentation:
1. **Jackpot Program Details** - Images show detailed jackpot structure with entry fees and distribution
2. **Free Coupons System** - Images show free coupons for binary slot upgrades
3. **Sweepover Mechanism** - Detailed sweepover rules in images

---

## 10. MATRIX STRUCTURE DETAILS

### Current Documentation:
Shows 3-9-27 structure but lacks details.

### Actual Project Images Show:
- **3-Level Structure**: 3 members at level 1, 9 at level 2, 27 at level 3
- **39 Total Members**: Complete matrix has 39 members
- **Recycle System**: When 39th member joins, matrix recycles
- **Sweepover Rules**: Detailed rules for when upline doesn't have slot active
- **Level Distribution**: 20% / 20% / 60% distribution across 3 levels

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Update Binary Program**: Add Slot 17 (CEO) and fix spelling errors
2. **Simplify Matrix Names**: Remove fancy tier names, use slot numbers
3. **Update Global Program**: Use simple Phase 1/2 structure with correct prices
4. **Fix Currency References**: Use "USDT" consistently
5. **Add Missing Programs**: Include Jackpot, Free Coupons, Sweepover details
6. **Update Percentages**: Use actual percentages from images
7. **Add Matrix Details**: Include 39-member structure and recycle system
8. **Complete Bonus Programs**: Add missing tiers and correct structures

---

## PRIORITY UPDATES NEEDED

### High Priority:
1. Binary slot names and Slot 17 addition
2. Matrix price corrections (Slot 14)
3. Global program structure simplification
4. Currency standardization (USDT)

### Medium Priority:
1. Complete Royal Captain and President Reward tables
2. Add missing programs (Jackpot, Free Coupons)
3. Update fund distribution percentages

### Low Priority:
1. Terminology consistency
2. Format standardization
3. Additional program details

## 11. ADDITIONAL MISMATCHES FROM FINAL REQUIREMENTS

### Missing Critical Implementation Details:

#### 11.1. Platform Deployment Requirements
**Missing from Documentation:**
- Smart contract deployment requirements
- Mother ID setup during contract deployment

#### 11.2. User Join Sequence Requirements
**Missing from Documentation:**
- **Mandatory sequence**: Binary → Matrix → Global (cannot join Global without Matrix, cannot join Matrix without Binary)
- **Referral ID system**: User gets unique referral ID after joining Binary
- **Referral ID reuse**: Same referral ID used across all programs

#### 11.3. Binary Program Auto-Activation Rules
**Missing from Documentation:**
- When user joins Binary, **both Slot 1 AND Slot 2 activate automatically**
- Each slot has separate tree structure
- Slot 1 joining fee goes to tree upline
- Other slots follow different distribution rules

#### 11.4. Tree Upline Reserve System
**Missing from Documentation:**
- **Tree upline reserve fund**: 30% of slot fee goes to tree upline's reserve for next slot activation
- **Automatic slot activation**: When reserve fund reaches next slot cost, automatic activation occurs
- **Mother account fallback**: If tree upline doesn't activate slot, fund goes to mother account

#### 11.5. Matrix Program Middle Position Logic
**Missing from Documentation:**
- **Middle 3 users rule**: From Level 2, the middle 3 users' slot fees fund next slot upgrade
- **Super upline detection**: System checks upline's upline level and position
- **Manual activation option**: Users can manually add funds to activate slots
- **Reserve combination**: 2 reserves + 1 manual fund, or 1 reserve + 2 manual funds

#### 11.6. Matrix Recycle System Details
**Missing from Documentation:**
- **39-member completion**: Each matrix slot completes with 39 members
- **Recycle mechanism**: When 39th user joins, new empty tree created
- **Recycle placement**: User moves to upline's same slot empty tree
- **Fund distribution**: Recycle user's fee distributed in new tree

#### 11.7. Sweepover Mechanism
**Missing from Documentation:**
- **Sweepover definition**: When upline not eligible, reward goes to super upline
- **60-level search**: System searches up to 60 levels for eligible upline
- **Slot activation requirement**: Upline must have target slot active to receive placement

#### 11.8. Global Program Tree Structure
**Missing from Documentation:**
- **First user priority**: Very first user's tree opens first
- **Serial placement**: All subsequent users placed serially in first user's Phase 1 Slot 1
- **Phase progression**: 4 users → Phase 2, 8 users → back to Phase 1 Slot 2

#### 11.9. Jackpot Program Detailed Structure
**Missing from Documentation:**
