# Nested Binary Tree Implementation

## Overview
Modified the `/binary/duel-tree-earnings/{uid}` API endpoint to return a **nested hierarchical tree structure** with `directDownline` arrays, limited to **3 levels** (Level 0, 1, 2).

### Structure
- **Level 0**: 1 user (root/self)
- **Level 1**: Up to 2 users (left + right direct downline)
- **Level 2**: Up to 4 users (each level 1 user can have left + right)
- **Maximum**: 7 users total (1 + 2 + 4)

## Changes Made

### 1. New Method: `_build_nested_binary_tree_limited()`
**Location:** `backend/modules/binary/service.py` (lines 1394-1497)

**Features:**
- Builds nested tree structure using recursive approach
- Each node contains a `directDownline` array with immediate children (max 2: left + right)
- Limited to **3 levels** (0, 1, 2) with maximum 7 users total
- Uses `parent_id` from `tree_placement` collection to determine relationships
- Ensures true binary tree: each parent has at most 2 children (first left + first right)
- Returns: `(root_node, max_depth, total_count)`

**Parameters:**
- `user_oid`: User ObjectId
- `max_levels`: Number of levels to traverse (default: 3)

**Binary Tree Guarantee:**
- For each parent, only the **first left child** and **first right child** are selected
- This ensures proper binary tree structure even if database has multiple entries

**Node Structure:**
```python
{
    "id": 0,
    "type": "self",  # or "downLine"
    "userId": "user123",
    "level": 0,
    "position": "root",  # or "left"/"right"
    "directDownline": [
        # Array of child nodes (same structure recursively)
    ]
}
```

### 2. Modified Method: `get_duel_tree_earnings()`
**Location:** `backend/modules/binary/service.py` (lines 1226-1337)

**Changes:**
- Now calls `_build_nested_binary_tree_limited()` instead of `_build_binary_downline_nodes()`
- Returns tree with nested structure
- Root node is wrapped in `nodes` array for consistency

## Key Features

### ✅ Nested Structure
- Each user node has a `directDownline` array
- Direct children are nested within their parent node
- Not a flat array anymore

### ✅ Parent-Child Relationships
- Uses `parent_id` from `tree_placement` collection
- Accurately represents the binary tree hierarchy
- Shows only **direct downlines** for each user

### ✅ 3 Levels with Maximum 7 Users
- Shows exactly 3 levels: 0 (root), 1 (direct children), 2 (grandchildren)
- Maximum 7 users: 1 + 2 + 4 = 7
- Level 0: 1 user (root)
- Level 1: Up to 2 users (left and right direct downline)
- Level 2: Up to 4 users (each level 1 user's left and right children)
- Prevents overwhelming frontend with too much data

### ✅ True Binary Tree
- Each parent node has **at most 2 children** (left and right)
- Only first left child and first right child are selected per parent
- Ensures proper binary tree structure

### ✅ Complete Node Information
Each node includes:
- `id`: Sequential node ID
- `type`: "self" (root) or "downLine"
- `userId`: User's UID
- `level`: Tree depth level (0 = root)
- `position`: "root", "left", or "right"
- `directDownline`: Array of immediate children (if any)

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Frontend can easily render nested tree structures
2. **Clear Relationships**: Direct parent-child relationships are explicit
3. **Performance**: Limited to 7 users prevents data overload
4. **Flexibility**: Easy to traverse and display in various formats

## Example Tree Visualization

```
Level 0:
[0] SELF - user123 (root)

Level 1:
├─ [1] DOWNLINE - AUTO001 (left)
└─ [2] DOWNLINE - AUTO002 (right)

Level 2:
   ├─ [3] DOWNLINE - AUTO004 (left child of AUTO001)
   ├─ [4] DOWNLINE - AUTO005 (right child of AUTO001)
   ├─ [5] DOWNLINE - USER001 (left child of AUTO002)
   └─ [6] DOWNLINE - USER002 (right child of AUTO002)

Total: 7 users (1 + 2 + 4)
```

**Actual Response Structure:**
```
user123 (Level 0)
├─ directDownline:
   ├─ AUTO001 (Level 1, left)
   │  └─ directDownline:
   │     ├─ AUTO004 (Level 2, left)
   │     └─ AUTO005 (Level 2, right)
   └─ AUTO002 (Level 1, right)
      └─ directDownline:
         ├─ USER001 (Level 2, left)
         └─ USER002 (Level 2, right)
```

## Testing

The implementation has been verified to:
- ✅ Build correct nested structure
- ✅ Limit to 7 users maximum
- ✅ Include all required fields
- ✅ Maintain proper parent-child relationships
- ✅ Use `parent_id` from `tree_placement` collection

## Backward Compatibility

- The `nodes` array still exists at the root level
- Contains a single root node with nested structure
- Slots data remains unchanged
- All other API response fields remain the same

## Related Endpoints Updated

### `/binary/duel-tree-details`
**Location:** `backend/modules/binary/router.py` (lines 323-375)
**Location:** `backend/modules/binary/service.py` (lines 1787-1835)

**Changes:**
- Updated to work with new nested `tree` structure instead of old `duelTreeData`
- When no `tree_id` provided, returns the entire tree structure
- When `tree_id` provided, recursively searches the nested tree to find the specific node
- Returns individual node with its `directDownline` intact

**Example:**
```
GET /binary/duel-tree-details?uid=user123
GET /binary/duel-tree-details?uid=user123&tree_id=3
```

## Notes

- The old `_build_binary_downline_nodes()` method is kept for backward compatibility with other endpoints
- `/binary/duel-tree-earnings/{uid}` and `/binary/duel-tree-details` use the new nested structure
- Other binary endpoints continue to use the flat structure
