### Binary Program Patterns
- **SLOT VALUE**: Each slot value doubles from the previous one
- **LEVEL**: Starts from 1 for CONTRIBUTOR, increments by 1
- **MEMBER**: Follows 2^Level pattern (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, 32768)
- **UPGRADE COST**: Generally equals the SLOT VALUE of the next tier
- **WALLET**: Calculated as TOTAL INCOME minus UPGRADE COST

### Tree Upline Reserve System
**CRITICAL FEATURE**: Tree upline reserve fund system for automatic slot activation.

#### Reserve Fund Rules:
- **30% of slot fee** goes to tree upline's reserve for next slot activation
- **Automatic slot activation**: When reserve fund reaches next slot cost, automatic activation occurs
- **Mother account fallback**: If tree upline doesn't activate slot, fund goes to mother account

#### Reserve Fund Logic:
1. **Level 1 or 2 User Activation**: If tree upline's 1st or 2nd level user activates a slot, entire fund goes to tree upline's reserve
2. **Automatic Upgrade**: Reserve fund automatically activates tree upline's next slot when sufficient funds accumulated
3. **Mother Account**: If tree upline doesn't activate target slot, fund goes to mother account
4. **Normal Distribution**: If target slot already activated, fund follows normal distribution percentages

#### Example Scenario:
- User C refers User H
- User H activates Slot 3
- Entire Slot 3 fee goes to User A's (tree upline) reserve for next slot activation
- System automatically activates User A's next slot when reserve reaches required amount

## 5. PLATFORM REQUIREMENTS AND DEPLOYMENT

### Smart Contract Deployment Requirements
- **Mother ID Setup**: The first ID must be set up during smart contract deployment
- **Mother ID Access**: Mother ID has access to all programs and serves as fallback for fund distribution
- **Unique Referral ID System**: Each user gets a unique referral ID after joining Binary program
- **Referral ID Reuse**: Same referral ID used across all programs (Binary, Matrix, Global)

### Mandatory Join Sequence
**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: Users MUST follow this exact sequence:
1. **Binary Program** (Required first) - Cannot join other programs without Binary
2. **Matrix Program** (Required second) - Cannot join Global without Matrix  
3. **Global Program** (Required third) - Final program in sequence

**Enforcement Rules**:
- No user can join Matrix without first joining Binary
- No user can join Global without first joining Matrix
- Referral ID from Binary is used for Matrix and Global programs

---

## 6. DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS

### Key Business Logic Points

1. **User Creation Success**:
   - When a user is successfully created, they should be added to the binary tree with 1 position
   - This triggers the binary tree placement logic

2. **User Join Process**:
   - When a user joins Binary, **BOTH Slot 1 AND Slot 2 activate automatically**
   - Each slot has separate tree structure
   - User gets unique referral ID for use across all programs

3. **Tree Placement Logic**:
   - Direct referral placement (when referrer has available positions)
   - Indirect referral placement (spillover when referrer's positions are full)

4. **Program Integration**:
   - Binary Program (BNB-based)
   - Matrix Program (USDT-based)
   - Global Program (USD-based)

### Implementation Priority

1. **Phase 1**: Binary Tree Placement System ✅ (Already implemented and tested)
2. **Phase 2**: User Creation Integration with Binary Tree
3. **Phase 3**: Slot Activation Logic (First 2 slots on user join)
4. **Phase 4**: Matrix Program Implementation
5. **Phase 5**: Global Program Implementation
6. **Phase 6**: Earning Calculation and Distribution
7. **Phase 7**: Multi-program Integration

---

## 6. NEXT STEPS

### Immediate Actions Needed

1. **Integrate User Creation with Binary Tree**:
   - Modify user creation process to automatically create binary tree placement
   - Ensure proper referrer assignment

2. **Implement Slot Activation Logic**:

## 7. BITGPT RANK SYSTEM

### Rank Overview
BitGPT has 15 special ranks, made from the combination of Binary and Matrix slots. Every time you activate a slot, you reach a new rank — showing your growth and leadership.

### 15 Special Ranks

#### Row 1 (Ranks 1-5):
1. **Bitron**
2. **Cryzen**
3. **Neura**
4. **Glint**
5. **Stellar**

#### Row 2 (Ranks 6-10):
6. **Ignis**
7. **Quanta**
8. **Lumix**
9. **Arion**
10. **Nexus**

#### Row 3 (Ranks 11-15):
11. **Fyre**
12. **Axion**
13. **Trion**
14. **Spectra**
15. **Omega**

### Rank System Logic
- Each rank is achieved by activating slots in Binary and Matrix programs
- Ranks represent leadership and growth within the platform
- Higher ranks indicate more active participation and team building

---

## 8. BINARY PARTNER INCENTIVE

### Core Incentive System
**IF A PERSON JOINS THE BINARY WITH 0.0066 BNB, THEIR UPLINE WILL RECEIVE A 10% COMMISSION FROM THE JOINING AND FROM EACH SLOT UPGRADE.**

### Binary Tree Structure
The system uses a binary tree structure where:
- Each user can have 2 direct referrals (left and right positions)
- Upline receives commissions from all downline activities
- Spillover occurs when direct positions are filled

### Commission Flow
- **Joining Commission**: 10% of joining fee (0.0066 BNB)
- **Upgrade Commission**: 10% of each slot upgrade
- **Upline Benefits**: Receives commissions from all levels below

---

## 9. DUAL TREE EARNING

### Level Income System
**Here is the list of Level Incomes that a person will receive when they upgrade a slot in the Binary.**

### Bonus Structure (From Level 2-16)
**Every Slot Upgrade (Bonus)**

| Level    | Percentage (%) |
| :------- | :------------- |
| Level 1  | 30%            |
| Level 2-3| 10%            |
| Level 4-10| 5%            |
| Level 11-13| 3%           |
| Level 14-16| 2%           |
| **Total** | **=100%**     |

### Dual Tree Logic
- Level 1 receives the highest bonus (30%)
- Bonuses decrease as levels increase
- Total bonus distribution equals 100%
- Encourages early participation and team building

---

## 10. AUTO UPGRADE SYSTEM

### Core Auto Upgrade Rule
**IN BITGPT, ALL UPGRADES WILL BE AUTOMATIC.**
**THE EARNINGS FROM THE FIRST TWO PEOPLE AT EACH LEVEL WILL BE USED FOR THE NEXT SLOT UPGRADE.**

### Auto Upgrade Mechanism
- **Requirement**: User needs 2 partners to activate their ID
- **Process**: Earnings from first 2 partners are used for next slot upgrade
- **Result**: User automatically goes to next level (2) with profit

### Auto Upgrade Flow
1. User ("ME") gets 2 direct referrals
2. First 2 partners generate earnings
3. Earnings are automatically used for next slot upgrade
4. User advances to next level with profit

### Activation Condition
**YOU MUST NEED 2 PARTNERS TO ACTIVATE YOUR ID AND YOU WILL GO NEXT LEVEL (2) WITH PROFIT!**

---

## 11. UPGRADE COMMISSION SYSTEM

### Commission Distribution Rule
**Whenever a partner upgrades to a specific slot, the upline at that exact level (corresponding to the slot number) will receive 30% upgrade commission. The remaining is distributed across Levels 1-16 as per Dual Tree rules.**

### Level-1 Special Rule
- For Slot 1 activations, the full Level-1 amount goes to the immediate upline.

### First-Two Reserve (Auto-Upgrade) Rule
- For Slots 2-16, the first two contributors at each level are reserved for the corresponding upline's upgrade at that slot number; remaining contributors are distributed by level rules.

### Example
**If a partner upgrades to Slot 5, the 5th upline will receive 30% upgrade commission from that slot's value.**

### Commission Flow Structure
- **Direct Commission**: 30% goes to upline at corresponding level
- **Distribution**: Remaining 70% distributed across levels 1-16
- **Level Matching**: Slot number must match upline level for 30% commission

### Upgrade Commission Logic
- When downline upgrades Slot 1 → Immediate upline gets 30% commission
- When downline upgrades Slot 2 → Immediate upline gets 30% commission
- When user upgrades Slot 3 → 3rd upline gets 30% commission
- When user upgrades Slot 4 → 4th upline gets 30% commission

## 12. BINARY MISSED PROFIT & LEVEL REWARDS

### Missed Rewards Scenarios
**MISSED REWARDS USUALLY OCCUR FOR TWO REASONS:**

1. **Account Inactivity**: The account is inactive and does not have two personal partners
2. **Level Advancement**: A member advances to a higher level than their sponsor

### Missed Profit Handling
**SUCH REWARDS ARE ACCUMULATED IN THE LEADERSHIP STIPEND AND DISTRIBUTED AMONG MEMBERS WHO ACHIEVE THE TARGETS.**

### Missed Commission Example
- **Scenario**: If you are on Level-4 and your team upgrades Slot-5 from Level-5
- **Result**: You will not get a commission because your level is lower than the upgrade slot
- **Handling**: Those missed profits go to the Leadership Stipend as reward

### Leadership Stipend System
- Missed profits are not lost

## 13. UPDATED DEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS

### Critical Business Logic Points

1. **User Creation Success**:
   - When a user is successfully created, they should be added to the binary tree with 1 position
   - This triggers the binary tree placement logic

2. **User Join Process**:
   - When a user joins, the first 2 slots of the binary program should become active
   - User needs 2 partners to activate their ID
   - Earnings from first 2 partners are used for auto-upgrade

3. **Auto Upgrade System**:
   - All upgrades are automatic
   - First 2 partners' earnings fund next slot upgrade
   - User advances to next level with profit

4. **Commission Structure**:
   - 10% commission on joining and slot upgrades
   - 30% upgrade commission to corresponding level upline
   - Remaining 70% distributed across levels 1-16

5. **Rank System**:
   - 15 special ranks (Bitron to Omega)
   - Achieved by activating Binary and Matrix slots
   - Represents leadership and growth

6. **Missed Profit Handling**:
   - Missed profits go to Leadership Stipend
   - Distributed to members who achieve targets
   - Prevents loss of commissions due to inactivity or level mismatches

### Implementation Priority (Updated)

1. **Phase 1**: Binary Tree Placement System ✅ (Already implemented and tested)
2. **Phase 2**: User Creation Integration with Binary Tree
3. **Phase 3**: Auto Upgrade System Implementation
4. **Phase 4**: Commission Calculation and Distribution
5. **Phase 5**: Rank System Implementation
6. **Phase 6**: Missed Profit and Leadership Stipend System
7. **Phase 7**: Matrix Program Implementation
8. **Phase 8**: Global Program Implementation
9. **Phase 9**: Multi-program Integration

## 17. LEADERSHIP STIPEND

### Overview
The Leadership Stipend provides daily returns for members who upgrade to higher-level slots (10-16).

### Stipend Rules
**If a person upgrades to any slot between 10 and 16, they will receive double the value of that slot as a daily return. However, if someone upgrades to another slot before receiving the full double amount from the previous slot, they will start receiving double the value of the new slot as a daily return.**

### Leadership Stipend Tiers

| Tier Name  | Slot Value (BNB) |
| :--------- | :--------------- |
| LEADER     | 1.1264 BNB       |

## 18. MATRIX PARTNER INCENTIVE

### Overview
The Matrix Partner Incentive provides commission structure for Matrix program participation.

### Incentive Structure
**IF A PERSON JOINS THE MATRIX WITH $11, THEIR UPLINE WILL RECEIVE A 10% COMMISSION FROM THE JOINING AND FROM EACH SLOT UPGRADE.**

### Matrix System Features
- **MATRIX HAS RECYCLE SYSTEM** - Special recycling mechanism
- **3x Matrix Structure** - Each level has 3 members under each parent
- **10% Commission** - On joining and slot upgrades
- **Upline Benefits** - Receives commissions from all downline activities

### Matrix Tree Structure
- **Level 1**: 3 members directly under you
- **Level 2**: 9 members (3 under each Level 1 member)
- **Level 3**: 27 members (3 under each Level 2 member)
- **Recycle System**: Special mechanism for matrix completion

### Matrix Recycle System (Detailed)
**CRITICAL FEATURE**: 39-member completion with automatic recycle mechanism.

#### Recycle System Rules:
- **39-Member Completion**: Each slot (1-15) completes with 39 members across 3 levels (3 + 9 + 27)
- **Automatic Recycle**: When all 39 positions fill, that slot RECYCLES to direct upline's corresponding slot
- **No Re-payment**: Recycled user doesn't pay joining fee again
- **Fund Distribution**: Triggering join/upgrade fee distributed in upline's tree
- **Level Income**: Distributed to First/Second/Third upline according to user's relative level in new tree

#### Recycle Process:
1. **Tree Completion**: Matrix slot reaches 39 members (3 + 9 + 27 structure)
2. **New Tree Creation**: New empty tree created for same slot
3. **Recycle Placement**: User moves to direct upline's same slot empty tree
4. **Fund Distribution**: Recycle user's fee distributed in new tree location
5. **Level Relationships**: Income distribution adjusts based on new tree placement

#### Recycle Placement Logic:
- **Level 1 Placement**: If recycled into upline's Level-1, upline becomes Level-2, their upline becomes Level-3
- **Level 2/3 Placement**: If placed into Level-2/3, relationships adjust accordingly for income distribution
- **BFS Placement**: Uses Breadth-First Search algorithm for optimal placement
- **Income Distribution**: Always resolves relative to new tree placement

#### Recycle Data Model:
- **Multiple Recycles**: User can have multiple recycle instances per slot
- **Immutable Snapshots**: Each recycle creates separate, immutable snapshot of 3-level tree
- **Historical Trees**: Previous trees can be fetched reliably even after multiple recycles
- **Completion Tracking**: System tracks recycle completion and triggers new tree creation

### Matrix Recycle Data Model
- A user can have multiple recycle instances per slot. Each recycle creates a separate, immutable snapshot of a 3-level tree (max 39 members).
- Storage is snapshot-based so historical trees can be fetched reliably, even after multiple recycles.

Entities:
- MatrixRecycleInstance
  - id (UUID/PK)
  - user_id (FK → users)
  - slot_number (1-15)
  - recycle_no (1-based counter per user_id + slot_number)
  - is_complete (boolean; true when all 39 positions are filled)
  - created_at, completed_at (timestamps)
  - UNIQUE(user_id, slot_number, recycle_no)
- MatrixRecycleNode
  - id (UUID/PK)
  - instance_id (FK → MatrixRecycleInstance)
  - occupant_user_id (FK → users)
  - level_index (1, 2, or 3)
  - position_index (0-based within level; 0..2 for L1, 0..8 for L2, 0..26 for L3)
  - placed_at (timestamp)
  - UNIQUE(instance_id, level_index, position_index)

Notes:
- If a user's slot has never recycled, the "current" tree is considered the in-progress tree; serve it partially with however many nodes exist.
- On each recycle completion, increment recycle_no and start a fresh in-progress tree for that slot.

### Placement and Indexing Rules (Authoritative)
- Level sizes: L1 = 3, L2 = 9, L3 = 27. Completion at 39 occupants.
- L1 index mapping: 0 = left, 1 = upline-reserve (middle), 2 = right.
- L2 indexing is breadth-first, left-to-right under L1 parents:
  - Positions 0..2 under L1[0]; 3..5 under L1[1]; 6..8 under L1[2].
  - Formula: L2 index = parentL1Index * 3 + childOffset (childOffset ∈ {0,1,2}).
- L3 indexing is breadth-first, left-to-right under L2 parents:
  - Positions 0..2 under L2[0], 3..5 under L2[1], …, 24..26 under L2[8].
  - Formula: L3 index = parentL2Index * 3 + childOffset.
- Placement algorithm (BFS): always place at the shallowest level with a vacancy, scanning left→right. L1 fills strictly in order: left → middle (upline-reserve) → right.
- Recycle re-entry placement: apply the same BFS algorithm in the direct upline's current in-progress tree for that slot. If that tree is full at the target level per rules, follow spillover to the next eligible upline path and continue BFS.
- Duplicate occupants: the same `occupant_user_id` may appear multiple times across trees due to recycle re-entries. Treat nodes as placements, not a global uniqueness constraint.

## 19. DREAM MATRIX

### Overview
The Dream Matrix is a mandatory program with specific earning requirements and profit calculations.

### Joining Requirements
**A PERSON MUST JOIN THE MATRIX BY PURCHASING THE FIRST SLOT, AND TO START EARNING, THEY MUST HAVE 3 DIRECT PARTNERS AS A MANDATORY REQUIREMENT.**

### Calculation Context
**For illustration purposes, the matrix program calculation has been based solely on the 5th slot, with a total value of $800. This approach helps simplify the explanation of the process.**

### Dream Matrix Profit Calculation

| Level | Member | Percentage(%) | 800$ | Total-Profit |
| :---- | :----- | :------------ | :--- | :----------- |
| 1     | 3      | 10%           | $80  | $240         |
| 2     | 9      | 10%           | $80  | $720         |
| 3     | 27     | 15%           | $120 | $3240        |
| 4     | 81     | 25%           | $200 | $16200       |
| 5     | 243    | 40%           | $320 | $77760       |
| **Total** | **363** | **100%** | **$800** | **$98160** |

### Dream Matrix Logic
- Mandatory 3 direct partners requirement
- Progressive commission percentages
- 3x matrix structure (3, 9, 27, 81, 243)
- Total profit calculation based on slot value

## 20. MATRIX AUTO UPGRADE SYSTEM

### Overview
The Matrix Auto Upgrade System automatically uses earnings from specific members to fund next slot upgrades.

### Auto Upgrade Rule
**FROM LEVEL 1 TO LEVEL 15, THE 100% EARNINGS FROM THE MIDDLE 3 MEMBERS WILL BE USED FOR THE NEXT SLOT UPGRADE.**

### Matrix Tree Structure
- **YOU** are at the top of your personal matrix
- **Level 1**: 3 members directly under you
  - Left member
  - **Upline Reserve** (middle)
  - Right member
- **Level 2**: 9 members (3 under each Level 1 member)
  - **Middle 3 members** (one under each Level 1 member) contribute 100% earnings for auto-upgrade
- **Level 3**: 27 members (3 under each Level 2 member)

### Auto Upgrade Logic
- **100% earnings from middle 3 members** at each level fund next slot upgrade
- **Automatic reinvestment** for next slot upgrade
- **Applies from Level 1 to Level 15**: This rule applies across all matrix levels
- **Upline Reserve position** for special handling

### Middle Position Logic
1. **Level 1 Structure**: 3 members directly under main user (left, middle/upline-reserve, right)
2. **Level 2 Structure**: 9 members (3 under each Level 1 member)
3. **Middle 3 Identification**: One member from each Level 1 branch (positions 4, 5, 6 in Level 2)
4. **Fund Collection**: 100% of middle 3 users' slot fees go to main user's next slot upgrade
5. **Manual Activation Option**: Users can manually add funds to activate slots
6. **Reserve Combination**: 2 reserves + 1 manual fund, or 1 reserve + 2 manual funds

### Super Upline Detection
- **System Check**: When user joins matrix, system checks upline's upline level and position
- **Middle Position**: If user is in middle position of their level, fee goes to super upline's slot activation fund
- **Manual Override**: Users can manually add funds to activate slots even without sufficient reserves

### Manual Upgrade Options
- You may upgrade manually using wallet funds.
- Reserve combination is allowed: with 2 reserves + 1 wallet share, or 1 reserve + 2 wallet shares to complete an upgrade.
- If the next slot is already upgraded, no further funds from that tree go into reserve.

### Sweepover Rules (Updated, Authoritative)
**CRITICAL FEATURE**: Sweepover mechanism with 60-level search for eligible upline.

#### Sweepover Definition:
- **Sweepover occurs** when a junior upgrades a slot before their upline/senior has upgraded the same slot
- **Junior jumps** into the super-upline's current in-progress tree for that slot (placed by BFS per matrix rules)
- **60-level search**: System searches up to 60 levels for eligible upline with target slot active
- **Slot activation requirement**: Upline must have target slot active to receive placement

#### Sweepover Logic:
1. **Eligibility Check**: When user activates slot, system checks if direct upline has that slot active
2. **Escalation Search**: If direct upline doesn't have slot, system searches up to 60 levels for eligible upline
3. **Placement**: User is placed in eligible upline's tree for that slot
4. **Income Distribution**: Placement and income references resolve relative to new tree placement
5. **Missed Income**: Skipped upline doesn't receive level-income for that slot (missed for that slot only)
6. **Future Restoration**: Normal distribution restored if senior upgrades first at later slots

#### Example Scenario:
- User A has Slot 5 active, User B has Slot 4, User C has Slot 3
- User D activates Slot 3 → placed in User C's tree (normal)
- User G activates Slot 4 → sweeps over User C (who doesn't have Slot 4) and goes to User B's tree
- User I activates Slot 4 → goes to User C's tree (since User C now has Slot 5 active)

### Eligibility Escalation and Fallback
- When resolving sweepover placement, check eligibility upward to the 60th-level upline for an upgraded holder of the target slot.
- If no eligible upline exists within 60 levels, place into the Mother ID’s tree for that slot.

### Level Distribution (Matrix) — 3 Levels: 20% / 20% / 60%
Matrix level-income distributes across the immediate three upline levels relative to the placed position:
- Level-1 (closest ancestor): 20%
- Level-2: 20%
- Level-3: 60%

Example with an $800 basis for illustration:

| Level | Team | %   | Per-member | Total      |
| :---- | :--- | :-- | :--------- | :--------- |
| 1     | 3    | 20% | $160       | $160×3 = $480 |
| 2     | 9    | 20% | $160       | $160×9 = $1440 |
| 3     | 27   | 60% | $320       | $320×27 = $8640 |
|       |      |      |            | **$10560** |

Summary: 1) 20%, 2) 20%, 3) 60%.

### Recycle Behavior with Sweepover
- Each slot (1–15) completes at 39 occupants (3/9/27) and then recycles. On recycle, a user re-enters the direct upline’s corresponding slot using BFS placement.
- If the user originally occupied a position via sweepover, they will re-enter the same super-upline’s tree on recycle, unless their immediate upline has upgraded that slot in the meantime. If the immediate upline later upgrades the same slot, subsequent upgrade/recycle for that slot will place under that upline per normal rules.
- Chain recycle: If a downline’s final placement completes the upline’s tree and triggers the upline’s recycle, both recycles occur. The triggering join/upgrade amount is accounted for in the upline’s tree at the tick-marked circle, and level-income distributes to the first/second/third uplines relative to that placement. This cascade may repeat multiple times.

### Direct vs Tree Upline (Authoritative)
- Direct Upline: The referral relationship. This never changes across slots or recycles.
- Tree Upline: The ancestor that receives level-income for a specific placement in a specific slot tree. This can change per slot and per recycle due to sweepover and BFS placement.

#### Initial Placement Resolution (Clarified)
- When a user joins Matrix for a given slot, resolve placement as follows:
  1) If the user's direct referrer (B) is active in Matrix for the target slot (or any eligible slot per rules), place the new user (C) under B's current in-progress tree using BFS. In this case, direct_upline = B and initial tree_upline = B. On later recycle(s), only tree_upline may change; direct_upline remains B.
  2) If the direct referrer (B) is not active in Matrix for that slot (or has not joined Matrix), escalate up to B's referrer (A) and check eligibility. If A is eligible, place C under A's tree using BFS. In this case, direct_upline = B (unchanged referral), but initial tree_upline = A. PI and Mentorship remain referral-based and continue to reference B (and B's referrer) regardless of tree placement.
  3) Continue escalation up the referral chain as needed (up to 60 levels). If no eligible upline is found within the escalation depth, place under the configured Mother ID's tree. In all cases, direct_upline never changes once set.

Notes:
- This behavior ensures sweepover/escalation never mutates the referral chain. Recycles can cause tree_upline to change (per sweepover and BFS), but direct_upline is immutable.

### Recycle Re-entry Algorithm (BFS with Ancestor Resolution)
When a user completes a slot (39 occupants) and recycles:
1) If the immediate upline has the same slot active, place the recycling user into the immediate upline’s current in-progress tree using BFS:
   - Try Level-1 first (any of the 3 direct positions). If none are free, proceed breadth-first to Level-2 then Level-3.
2) If the immediate upline does NOT have that slot active, escalate upward to the next upline who has that slot active and space available, using the same BFS rule. Continue escalation up to 60 levels; if none is eligible, place into the Mother ID’s tree for that slot.
3) The resulting three ancestors above the placed position define Level-1/2/3 for income distribution (20/20/60).

Implication: A user may temporarily appear under a super-upline’s tree (sweepover or recycle), while the direct upline relationship remains unchanged. Later, if the skipped upline activates the relevant slot (or a higher slot before the downline’s next upgrade), subsequent placements can return under that upline’s tree.

### Worked Example (Slots 3 and 4)
Assume the hierarchy: You (A) → Me (B) → My Downline (D).
- A has Slot-3 active. D has Slot-3 active. B does NOT yet have Slot-3.
- D completes Slot-3 and recycles. Since B lacks Slot-3, D is placed into A Slot-3 tree by BFS. This may place D at A Level-1 if a direct position is free, otherwise at Level-2/3 per BFS. During this time, Tree Upline for D@Slot-3 is A. Direct Upline remains B.
- Later, B upgrades Slot-3. Before D upgrades to Slot-4, D’s next placement (e.g., D’s Slot-4 join/upgrade) will resolve under B’s tree if B has Slot-4 first (or activates the relevant slot before D’s corresponding upgrade). Thus Tree Upline for D@Slot-4 becomes B, while Direct Upline was always B.

### Bonuses Unaffected by Sweepover
- Partner Incentive (10%), Newcomer Growth Support, and Mentorship Bonus are not impacted by sweepover; they distribute per their normal rules regardless of the tree used for level-income.

### Notes
- “Second-level middle three fund the next slot” remains the authoritative auto-upgrade rule for Matrix and is unchanged here.
- For concrete scenarios (e.g., junior upgrades $60 and sweeps over a non-upgraded upline into a super-upline’s tree), recycle re-entry will remain in that same tree so long as the skipped upline stays non-upgraded at that slot. If the upline later upgrades (e.g., $60 and $240), then when the junior reaches the higher slot (e.g., $240) the placement and distribution will occur under the upgraded upline per normal.

### Partner Incentive & Mentorship Bonus (Matrix) — Distribution Rules
- Partner Incentive (PI) — 10%: Paid to the direct sponsor/upline of the user who joins or upgrades a Matrix slot. This is always based on the referral chain (not tree placement). Unaffected by sweepover or recycle.
- Mentorship Bonus — 10%: Paid to the “super upline” (the sponsor of the sponsor) for transactions made by the direct-of-direct partner (i.e., your direct’s direct). Also based on the referral chain and unaffected by sweepover or recycle.
- Scope: Both apply on Matrix join ($11) and on every Matrix slot upgrade (slots 1–15) per slot value.
- Independence: PI and Mentorship are independent of the 20/20/60 level-income and of reserve mechanics. They are computed in parallel with level-income.
- Missing super upline: If a super upline does not exist for a user (no sponsor-of-sponsor), the Mentorship portion for that user does not apply.

Example:
- If X joins/upgrade a Matrix slot and S is X’s direct sponsor, Y is S’s sponsor:
  - PI 10% of the slot amount → S (direct sponsor of X).
  - Mentorship 10% of the slot amount → Y (sponsor of S), because X is a direct-of-direct relative to Y.
  - These payouts are independent of whether X’s level-income flows under S’s tree or under any super-upline’s tree due to sweepover.


### Matrix Recycle Tree API
- Fetch a user's matrix tree by recycle number and slot. Frontend provides user_id and recycle_no; backend returns the tree snapshot for that recycle. If multiple recycles happened, there will be multiple trees per user.
- If no recycle exists yet for that slot, return the current in-progress tree (partial), with however many members exist.

Endpoints:
- GET `/matrix/recycle-tree?user_id={uid}&slot={1-15}&recycle_no={n|current}`
  - recycle_no: integer ≥ 1, or the string `current` to force the in-progress tree
  - Behavior:
    - If recycle_no = current → return current in-progress tree
    - If recycle_no ≤ max recycle for that user+slot → return the matching snapshot
    - If recycle_no > max recycle (or none exist) → return current in-progress tree
  - Response shape:
    ```json
    {
      "user_id": "...",
      "slot_number": 1,
      "recycle_no": 2,
      "is_snapshot": true,
      "is_complete": true,
      "total_recycles": 3,
      "nodes": [
        { "level": 1, "position": 0, "user_id": "..." },
        { "level": 1, "position": 1, "user_id": "..." },
        { "level": 1, "position": 2, "user_id": "..." },
        { "level": 2, "position": 0, "user_id": "..." }
        // ... up to 39 for complete snapshots; partial for in-progress
      ]
    }
    ```
  - Metadata helps frontend navigate between snapshots and current state.

- GET `/matrix/recycles?user_id={uid}&slot={1-15}`
  - Returns a list of recycle instances for that user+slot with `recycle_no`, `is_complete`, `created_at`, `completed_at`.

| 14   | 4%             |
| **Total** | **= 100%**     |

### Spark Bonus Logic
- **Fund Sources**: 8% from Binary + 8% from Matrix + 5% from Global = 21% total
- **Triple Entry Reward**: 20% of Spark Bonus + 5% from Global = 25% total
- **Remaining Distribution**: 80% of Spark Bonus treated as 100% baseline
- **Matrix Slot Distribution**: 14 slots with progressive percentages
- **Distribution Frequency**: Every 30 days for 60 days (2 distributions per slot completion)

### Triple Entry Reward Details
- **Eligibility**: Users who join all three programs (Binary + Matrix + Global) in first step
- **Return Amounts**:
  - Binary: 0.006 BNB (2 slots: 0.002 + 0.004)
  - Matrix: $11 (first slot)
- **Distribution**: Equal distribution among all Triple Entry users
- **Frequency**: Every 30 days

### Spark Bonus Distribution Example
**Example Scenario**: 1000 users in Matrix Slot 1 today
- **Fund Allocation**: 15% of total Spark fund for Slot 1
- **Distribution**: Equal among all 1000 users
- **Calculation**: If total Spark fund = $1000, then Slot 1 gets $150 (15%)
- **Per User**: $150 ÷ 1000 = $0.15 per user

**Slot-wise Distribution**:
- Slot 1 (100 users): 15% of fund
- Slot 2 (80 users): 10% of fund  
- Slot 3 (60 users): 10% of fund
- Slot 4 (40 users): 10% of fund
- Slot 5 (20 users): 10% of fund
- And so on for all 14 slots

## 26. PHASE-1 AND PHASE-2 SYSTEM

### Overview
The Phase-1 and Phase-2 system is a global pool progression mechanism that automatically upgrades users through different phases and slots.

### System Rules

1. **Joining**: **WHEN A PERSON JOINS THE GLOBAL POOL WITH $33, THEY ARE PLACED IN SLOT 1 OF PHASE 1.**

2. **Phase 1 to Phase 2 Upgrade**: **ONCE 4 PEOPLE ARE PLACED GLOBALLY UNDER THEM, THEIR SLOT IS AUTOMATICALLY UP-GRADED, AND THEY MOVE TO PHASE 2, OCCUPYING SLOT 1 THERE.**

3. **Phase 2 to Phase 1 Re-entry**: **WHEN THEIR SLOT 1 IN PHASE 2 IS COMPLETED WITH 8 PEOPLE GLOBALLY UNDER THEM, THEY RE-ENTER PHASE 1 AND ARE PLACED IN SLOT 2.**

4. **Continuation**: **THIS PROCESS CONTINUES, FOLLOWING THE DIAGRAM BELOW, UNTIL REACHING SLOT 16.**

### Phase Progression Flow
```
YOU
↓
PHASE-1, SLOT-1 (4 people) → UPGRADE
↓
PHASE-2, SLOT-1 (8 people) → UPGRADE
↓
PHASE-1, SLOT-2 (4 people) → UPGRADE
↓
PHASE-2, SLOT-2 (8 people) → UPGRADE
↓
...continues until SLOT 16
```

### Phase System Logic
- **PHASE-1**: Requires 4 people globally under user (4 slots per person)
- **PHASE-2**: Requires 8 people globally under user (8 slots per person)

3. **Phase Progression**: 4 users → Phase 2, 8 users → back to Phase 1 Slot 2
4. **Continuous Flow**: Process continues with all users following first user's progression

#### Placement Logic:
- **Very First User**: Platform's first user (could be Mother ID) gets tree priority
- **Serial Tree Building**: All next users placed serially in first user's Phase 1 Slot 1
- **Phase 1 Completion**: When 4 users fill first user's Phase 1 Slot 1, first user upgrades to Phase 2 Slot 1
- **Phase 2 Completion**: When 8 users fill first user's Phase 2 Slot 1, first user upgrades to Phase 1 Slot 2
- **Continuous Cycle**: Process repeats for all subsequent slots

#### Tree Distribution Logic:
